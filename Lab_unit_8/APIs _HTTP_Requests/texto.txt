The API (Application Programming Interface), as the name suggests, is a computing interface that defines the set of rules for the interaction between multiple applications. You can thought of it as of the set of rules of engagement/contract with the documentation of agreement between the interacting parties (applications in this case). In this lesson, we will learn how to connect to an API (the SpotiPy), understand how the API works (using different endpoints) to extract relevant information from applications and/or websites.
